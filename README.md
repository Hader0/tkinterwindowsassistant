# tkinterwindowsassistant
A small, quick windows assistant created using Tkinter and Python. It's a stepping stone to getting better with Python

This Python Assistant is a very basic application with an easier way of working it:

1. The search function opens up a new tab in your default browser. This table searches what was entered in either Google, Wikipedia or YouTube.
2. The math solver shows the result from the two entered numbers to 3 decimal places. This includes Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.
3. PC control is a quick way of restarting, shutting down or putting your computer to sleep. The 'Confirm' button needs to be clicked to confirm your decision.
